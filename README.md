# Hsp90_DFE

Code the generate fit of DFE in different environments in the article (TO FILL).

For now only the fit on all data by environments of the mixture is available in the script.

The fitting procedure suffer multiple approximations. Thus, the parameters' values
should not be interpreted quantitatively but only in qulitatively in relation to
each others.

- The data on which the fits are based is in CSV format in **/Data**.
- The functions for the DFE are in **/R** in *dfe_functions.R*
- The script to generate the fits by environments are in **/R** in *fit.R*
- The results of the fit are in .rds format in **/Analysis**.
- The notebook containing the figure is in **Analysis** in *Figure_fit_mixture.Rmd*
